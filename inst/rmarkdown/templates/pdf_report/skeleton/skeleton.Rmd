# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

This is a template for creating statistical reports with the `cqThemes` package. It provides consistent formatting, color palettes, and styling functions to create professional-looking reports.

## Purpose of This Report {#sec-purpose}

This template demonstrates the formatting features of the `cqThemes` package:

- Consistent plot themes with `theme_cq_pdf()`
- Well-formatted tables with `format_table_pdf()`
- Coordinated color palettes with `cq_colors()`
- Other utilities for statistical reporting

## Data Sources {#sec-data-sources}

This template uses example datasets included in R:

- `mtcars`: Motor Trend Car Road Tests
- `iris`: Edgar Anderson's Iris Data
- `diamonds`: Diamond prices and characteristics (from ggplot2)

# Data Analysis {#sec-analysis}

## Data Overview {#sec-overview}

Let's start with a basic overview of the dataset:

```{r table-overview}
# Create a summary table
mtcars_summary <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(
    Count = n(),
    `Avg MPG` = mean(mpg),
    `Avg HP` = mean(hp),
    `Avg Weight` = mean(wt),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Format table with cqThemes
format_table_pdf(
  mtcars_summary,
  caption = "Summary Statistics by Number of Cylinders",
  digits = 2,
  highlight_row = 2
)
```

## Visualizations {#sec-viz}

Now let's create some visualizations using the cqThemes styling:

```{r scatter-plot, fig.cap="Relationship between MPG and Horsepower by Number of Cylinders"}
# Create a scatterplot with the cqThemes PDF theme
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "MPG vs. Horsepower",
    subtitle = "By Number of Cylinders",
    x = "Miles per Gallon",
    y = "Horsepower",
    color = "Cylinders"
  ) +
  theme_cq_pdf() +
  scale_color_manual(values = cq_colors(3, type = "categorical"))
```

```{r box-plot, fig.cap="Distribution of MPG by Number of Cylinders"}
# Create a boxplot with the cqThemes PDF theme
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg, fill = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of MPG by Cylinder Count",
    x = "Number of Cylinders",
    y = "Miles per Gallon"
  ) +
  theme_cq_pdf() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cq_colors(3, type = "categorical")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Statistical Analysis {#sec-stats}

Let's examine the correlation between variables:

```{r correlation-matrix, fig.cap="Correlation Matrix of Car Features"}
# Create a correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(mtcars[, c("mpg", "disp", "hp", "drat", "wt", "qsec")])

# Create a correlation plot using cqThemes
create_correlation_plot(
  cor_matrix,
  title = "Correlation Matrix of Car Features"
)
```

The correlation matrix shows:

- Strong negative correlation between MPG and weight
- Strong positive correlation between displacement and horsepower
- Moderate positive correlation between displacement and weight

Let's explore one more visualization using a different color palette:

```{r facet-plot, fig.cap="Relationship between MPG and Weight by Number of Cylinders and Transmission Type"}
# Create a faceted plot with the cqThemes PDF theme
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(am))) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, alpha = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl, nrow = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "MPG vs. Weight by Cylinders and Transmission",
    x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles per Gallon",
    color = "Transmission"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = cq_colors(2),
    labels = c("Automatic", "Manual")
  ) +
  theme_cq_pdf()
```

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This template has demonstrated the key features of the `cqThemes` package for creating professional statistical reports:

1. **Consistent styling** across all visualizations
2. **Well-formatted tables** with custom highlighting
3. **Coordinated color palettes** for different types of data
4. **Specialized visualization functions** like correlation plots

## Next Steps {#sec-next-steps}

To use this template for your own reports:

1. Replace the example data with your own dataset
2. Customize the visualizations as needed
3. Update the text and analysis to match your data
